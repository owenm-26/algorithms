# Algorithms
A collection of classic algorithms I implemented to stay fresh

### Algorithm Complete
- [x] Binary Search
- [x] Merge Sort
- [x] Quicksort
- [x] Reverse Linked List
- [x] BFS
- [ ] DFS
- [ ] Reverse a Tree
- [ ] Kruskal's (MST)
- [ ] Dijkstra's

## Purpose
In order to not forget these important algorithms I created this repository for both reference as well as a way to track how often I implement them from scratch.

## Plan
To implement each of these algorithms once <b>every two months</b>. I later hope to implement these algorithms in multiple languages, but for now I will start with Python since that is what I leetcode with.

## Algorithm List
1. Binary Search
2. Merge Sort
3. Quicksort
4. Reverse Linked List
5. BFS
6. DFS
7. Reverse a Tree
8. Kruskal's (MST)
9. Dikhstra's
