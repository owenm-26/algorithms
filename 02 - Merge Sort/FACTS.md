# Algorithm Facts
A classic way to sort an array. It is a comparison sort. Divide-and-Conquer Algorithm that recursively breaks down and reassembles an array 

## Time Complexity
O(nlogn) - sorts 2 lists at every step that is half the size of the original, n times.

## Space Complexity
O(n) - Doesn't duplicate every step, just slices. However the resulting array is a new one of length n.
