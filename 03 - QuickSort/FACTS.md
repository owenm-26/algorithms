# Algorithm Facts
In place sorting algorithm that is more efficient than Merge Sort. It is not stable but it is a comparision sort.

## Time Complexity
Average is O(nlogn) but worst case is O(n^2) when you pick a pivot that is the highest/lowest of the subarray every time.

## Space Complexity
O(n) - We create 2 lists every iteration that are each half the size of the original
