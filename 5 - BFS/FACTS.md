# Algorithm Facts
Used to find 
- the distance between any node and its children
- explore an entire tree of connected components
- finding the shortest path between 2 nodes
- MST for a unit weight / unweighted tree
- start of Ford-Fulkerson

## Time Complexity
O(n) - explores every node once, doesn't revisit nodes

## Space Complexity
O(nm) - the input has n nodes and m branches
